## Black Friday - Consumer Marital Status Prediction
Data source: Kaggle

Motivation: Black Friday is only a few weeks away. ðŸ˜„

In coding challenge 3, I created a linear regression model. This time, I created a random forest classifier to predict the marital status of a consumer based on other features in the data set.

Please access the file model.ipynb for my classification model.
