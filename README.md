Everyone including new comers is encouraged to participate!

The winning submission should ideally contain:

- an interesting model application.
- a reasonably accurate model.
- documentation explaining your process.
- To submit, post your submission's repository link on the #coding_challenge  Slack channel (on the Vancouver School of AI workspace) before the due date.

## Black Friday - Consumer Marital Status Prediction
Data source: Kaggle

Motivation: Black Friday is only a few weeks away. 😄

In coding challenge 3, I created a linear regression model. This time, I created a random forest classifier to predict the marital status of a consumer based on other features in the data set.

Please access the file model.ipynb for my classification model.

I wanted to use `hyperopt` and `GridSearchCV` to optimize my classifier but the training took too long so I had to leave out in this analysis.
